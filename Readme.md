# Robot World CRUD

Create your own Sinatra app from scratch. This app should be a directory of robots. A robot has a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department. Program the CRUD functionality for robots so that we can see all robots, see one specific robot, edit/update a robot, create a robot, and delete a robot. Use [http://robohash.org/](http://robohash.org/) for pictures. Add a dashboard that shows statistical data: average robot age, a breakdown of how many robots were hired each year, and number of robots in each department/city/state.
